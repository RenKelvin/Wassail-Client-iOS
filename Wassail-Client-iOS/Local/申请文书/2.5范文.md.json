With the increasing complexity of technology and career skills, they have to do more and learn more with every passing  day. Until now, technology has perpetuated itself not by giving the average person more time to pursue humane concerns, but by increasing efficiency. People can turn out more widgets in an hour now than they ever could, but they also work more than ever learning new things. For example, the average employee spends an hour a day writing and receiving email, but still must accomplish everything else she used to do. There is now more to do in less time, and adults are right to complain that they wished they had more hands or more time to accomplish their daily chores.",

I was introduced to Bayesian Statistics, GARCH processes, and other topics of time series analysis. I also learned how to price volatility swaps and categorize different optimization tasks. While I never intended to focus solely on the practical side of finance, nearly all of my work revolves around it.

The idea of maximizing expected return and minimizing risk is simple but breathtakingly powerful in explaining how assets are valued. I enjoy learning about the interaction of economic variables like inflation or interest rates, how the economy works, and how changes of factors like currency return or oil price affects market movement. One of the aspects of finance that I find most interesting is its application of knowledge from other areas of discipline. For example, Brownian motion is used to model and evaluate options while eigenvalues and eigenvectors are used to decompose and analyze covariance matrices. These examples show that finance researchers are able to take advantage of the established knowledge of other fields like Mathematics and Statistics and apply them to assist in their research. I also believe that my excellent quantitative background makes me well suited to handle finance\u2019s demanding level of mathematical rigor.",

But I am most impressed with its quantitative approach to finance. MIT combines its strength in engineering and economics to develop an expertise in finance that focuses on the quantitative aspect. In particular, I am interested in the work of Dr. Andrew Lo, who is a prominent figure in the area of neural networks and derivative pricing. I am also attracted to MIT\u2019s small class sizes since it would enable me to work closely, share experiences, and exchange ideas with my professors and peers. One line of research I hope to pursue is of the financial market development of emerging market countries. I have always wondered whether established finance theory applies to the behavior of developing countries or whether there are alternative models to explain such market behavior. What should be the appropriate strategy to ensure stable development in these countries?financial markets? Can the lack of pension funds to support the market be the reason for the huge volatility and low liquidity of the financial markets in the developing countries? Are there any common factors driving their market variations? Through the Ph.D. program, I hope to find answers to the above questions and to conduct extensive research on similar financial market topics.I believe there is still much to be explored and studied in finance academia, and I believe the Sloan doctoral program would provide me with the knowledge necessary to understand and apply finance theories, which I could in turn bring to my teaching and research career.
